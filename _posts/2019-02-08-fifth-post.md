### Sketch Tutorial

For this tutorial I created a prototype of a responsive website related to healthy lifestyle using sketch. 

Sketch is a digital design app from Mac. You can use it for UI, mobile, web and even icon design. It is a vector-based app. In my opinion, it is much easier than any other designing app.

We can easily get this app from internet. We can use it for free for 1 month and after that we have to pay one time and can use this app as long as we want.

## Using Artboards in Sketch and responsive design: 

1.	Press A on keyboard, it will bring up the artboards that sketch has already added. We will choose desktop, tablet and mobile view for this tutorial. We can also resize our artboards as we can give own height and width.

2.	To create logo for my website I am going to use some shapes and text. For the circle we will go to insert->shape->oval and for the text insert->text. We can fill colors in text and shapes by going to style on the right side. Under style we have fills, borders, shadows, inner shadows and blur. We can group our site logo by pressing command+ G and change the name of layer by double clicking on layer.

3.	Now we can make this logo a symbol and can use this symbol anywhere in website easily. Select the logo, at the top bar we have option of create symbol, click on that and give your symbol a name. we can see our symbol under symbols option on the left bar.

4.	Follow the same steps for search bar and for this we will use rectangle and oval.
5.	For the nav bar I am going to use rectangle and fill it with dark green color with and display menu options with white color. To change color of the text, go to style-> fills and choose color of your choice.

6.	I am going to use some pictures for this website, and I will download some pictures related to my website from www.unsplash.com. I only need half of the image so, to cut the image I am going to use mask. 
7.	Draw a shape on the image on that area of image which you want to use. In the layers panel image layer must be above the rectangle. Now, select both rectangle and image and on the top bar click on mask option.

10.	To properly align everything on artboard I am going to use grids. To show grids on artboard go to, View->Canvas->Show grid. We can adjust grid block size and think lines every by going to, View->Canvas->Grid settings. I am using 65px and 10 respectively and click OK.

11.	I am not displaying whole text for article on home page, so I am going to create read more button and to do this I am using rectangle and text. Group the button and also make it a symbol because we will need this many time for other articles.

12.	By following above steps, we will create other articles for our website.
13.	Now for the icons for footer we will use https://icomoon.io/. I am going to download Facebook, Instagram and twitter icons for my website. Now to align icons in the footer we can use align options on the top right side. Now we come up with desktop view.

14.	As we already have our font style, colors, symbols, buttons, images and icons from the desktop view. Now, it is easier for us to make tablet and mobile view for our website.
15.	Press A on the keyboard and select tablet artboard. Now, for the articles of tablet view I am going to use some shadow to make them effective. To give shadow select the rectangle and go to style->shadow and set the x and y values for shadow.
16.	By repeating the same steps as in desktop view, I come up with tablet view and for the tablet view I am, displaying text along with images.
17.	Press A on the keyboard and select mobile artboard. I am making a single column layout for mobile view. 
18.	To make other mockups we can just drag artboards by pressing option key on the keyboard and make copies of artboards.
