# First week post



I choose sketch to make my first project for directed studies because of the following reasons:
1. Sketch is a quicker way of designing. We can design beautiful interfaces just by using few plugins and templates. 
2. Sketch is a great application for UI design.
3. It is much easier and faster to design our app in sketch as compared to other designing tools for example, illustrator
