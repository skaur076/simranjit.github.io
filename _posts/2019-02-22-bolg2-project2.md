I did a course on linda.com and here is the link:-[https://www.lynda.com/Figma-tutorials/Setting-up-team/711832/755919-4.html?autoplay=true](https://www.lynda.com/Figma-tutorials/Setting-up-team/711832/755919-4.html?autoplay=true). I learnt how to use frames in figma, how to use shapes, make icons , inserting images, ginig effects to images, how to make components and learn about vertical and horizontal scrolling in figma. I made a mobile app 'Tour to India' and made login, home page , article and related artboards.
