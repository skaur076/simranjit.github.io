Hello everyone
My name is Simranjit Kaur and i want to share with all of you what will be my first project.

## I choose sketch to make my first project for directed studies because of the following reasons:
1. Sketch is a quicker way of designing. We can design beautiful interfaces just by using few plugins and templates. 
2. Sketch is a great application for UI design.
3. It is much easier and faster to design our app in sketch as compared to other designing tools for example, illustrator. 

## What will i build:

After seeing many videos on youtube and Lynda.com and i learn many things about sketch. I believe i can do best by using sketch. So far, i have decided to make dseigns for a mobile app which would be related to healthy life style. I will use many different styles, plugins, templates to make my prototype really effective. I will make responsive designs. 

## Deliverables

1. Icons for the apllication.
2. Approximately 10 artboards with responsive designs.
3. Designs with the use of almost all the properties of sketch such as toolbox, plugins, templates and many more which i will learn further.
