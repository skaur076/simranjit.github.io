# Figma

## I choose figma to make my second project for directed studies because of the following reasons:

We can design our websites in a very effective way in figma. Figma is the first interface design tool based in the browser, making it easier for teams to create software. We can share our work with other team members and get feedback from them with the help of Figma. 

## What will i build:

After seeing many videos on youtube and Lynda.com and i learn many things about figma. I believe i can do best by using figma. So far, i have decided to make prototypes for a website. 


## Deliverables
I will deliver a mobile app prototype which i will make using all the properties of Figma. I am making a app in which people can explore about India. I will make 10 artboards related to app. I am using iphone X frame of figma for this.
