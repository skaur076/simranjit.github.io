# Overall Progress

I have learned a new tool for designing and is quite interseting. When I started learning figma i was thinking of making a website and then I changed my thoughts and made mobile application. I have created what I want. I used almost each feature of figma excluding working in teams and code generation.

# Lessons learned and unexpected challenges

I learned about a best app as this is the first time I used figma for designing. Before figma, I always used illustrator, sketch for designing. And figma is above of all the compititors. When I was working with this tool, I faced some problems:
1. How to use hotspots in figma.
2. How to change the size of frames without changing content.
3. Problems using scrolling property.

# Future Work

For all of my future designing work I will use figma as it is easy and team-based application. When working with team it will be really helpful.
